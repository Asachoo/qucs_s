    // This is the core method to render the schematic. It employs
    // an approach similar to MVC (model-view-controller).
    //
    // There is a "model plane" â€“ a rectangle located somewhere in some
    // abstract cartesian coordinate system. This coordinate system has
    // its X-axis directed left-to-right and Y-axis top-to-bottom. Every element
    // of the schematic "lives" in this coordinate system inside the model
    // plane. The model plane is described by class properties ViewX1, ViewY1,
    // ViewX2, ViewY1.
    //
    // To see the schematic we need to "render" the model plane. To do so the
    // "view plane" is used. Technically it is the Q3ScrollView's "contents",
    // but in the abstraction being described its just another plane. In
    // contrast to the model plane, its top-left corner is always (0,0), but the
    // axes are directed the same way: left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
    //
    // The "scale" is the ratio between the view plane and model plane sizes.
    // When being rendered, the model is like being "projected" on the view
    // plane. Think of the film projector: the film ("model") could be displayed
    // on screens ("views") of different sizes by adjusting the lense ("scale").
    //
    // Finally there is a "viewport". Technically its the very Q3ScrollView
    // widget, but in the abstraction being described its the part of the
    // view which is currently observed by the user. Sometimes the view is
    // very large (when we "zoom in") and only the part of it could be observed.
    //
    // Summarizing everything said:
    // 1. The model plane is drawn on the view plane at some scale and then
    // a part of the view plane is observed by the user.
    // 2. <size in model plane> * <Scale> = <size in view plane>

    // end. We do this because the "should-be-displayed" area might go beyond
    // the model plane bounds, in which case the model plane size would have to
    // be adjusted to include this area.
